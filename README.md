# Unity-Game - Outsider

The main purpose of this project was to experiment with games in Unity, the Unity engine.
This is my first attempt at making a 2d game in Unity.
Features: 
  -Player movement
  -Player animation
  -Player attack
  -Enemy: - attack player
          - chase after player

The map is made by me, using the Unity tile palette.

This project was inspired by this series on youtube:
